            Student in Computer Science at Politehnica University of Bucharest.<br>
            I'm from Reșița, Caraș-Severin, a beautiful city in western Romania, particularly
            in the mountainous region of Banat.<br>
            I come from a family of engineers and I like to think that the idea of following
            the same path as my parents comes from a desire to know how the inner parts of the
            things we use all day in our lives work and how these things can be improved in order
            to make it easier for us to reach new levels of knowledge. I have no problem with living
            my life in a world where technology has advanced so much that we forget sometimes how life
            and human relationships used to be a couple of years ago. After all, Computer Science is
            the domain I have choosen to practice because I believe that all future innovations
            that are going to happen in the world will rely on computers and their power of processing data
            and, if I am to be honest, I would like to be a part of what this means. On the other hand, I believe
            that the moments we spend with our family, friends or in nature are more precious than everything and
            this is why striking a balance between our working life and these moments represent one of our most
            important objectives in life.
